Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or replies, fping will\nsend out a ping packet and move on to the next host in a round-robin fashion.\nIf a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of hosts to check.\nIf a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it\nwill be considered unreachable.",
