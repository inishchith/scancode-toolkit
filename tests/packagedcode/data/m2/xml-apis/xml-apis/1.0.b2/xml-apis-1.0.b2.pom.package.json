Our hope is that we \n    can standardize on both a common version and packaging scheme for these \n    critical XML standards interfaces to make the lives of both our developers \n    and users easier. The External Components portion of xml-commons contains \n    interfaces that are defined by external standards organizations. For DOM, \n    that's the W3C; for SAX it's David Megginson and sax.sourceforge.net; for \n    JAXP it's Sun.",
